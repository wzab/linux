Rockchip SoC Image Signal Processing unit v1
----------------------------------------------

Rockchip ISP1 is the Camera interface for the Rockchip series of SoCs
which contains image processing, scaling, and compression funcitons.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following
	"rockchip,rk3288-cif-isp";
	"rockchip,rk3399-cif-isp";
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: should contain ISP interrupt.
- clocks: phandle to the required clocks.
- clock-names: required clock name.
- iommus: required a iommu node.
- phys: the phandle for the PHY port
- phy-names: must contain "dphy"

port node
-------------------

The device node should contain one 'ports' child node, with children 'port'
with child 'endpoint'.
nodes, according to the bindings defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/
media/video-interfaces.txt.

- endpoint(mipi):
	- remote-endpoint: Connecting to Rockchip MIPI-DPHY,
		which is defined in rockchip-mipi-dphy.txt.

The port node must contain at least one endpoint, either parallel or mipi.
It could have multiple endpoints, but please note the hardware don't support
two sensors work at a time, they are supposed to work asynchronously.

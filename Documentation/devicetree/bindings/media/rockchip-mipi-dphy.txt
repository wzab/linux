Rockchip SoC MIPI RX D-PHY
-------------------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following
	"rockchip,rk3288-mipi-dphy"
	"rockchip,rk3399-mipi-dphy"
- clocks : list of clock specifiers, corresponding to entries in
	clock-names property;
- clock-names: required clock name.
- #phy-cells: Number of cells in a PHY specifier; Should be 0.

MIPI RX D-PHY use registers in "general register files", it
should be a child of the GRF.
MIPI TXRX D-PHY have its own registers, it must have a reg property.

Optional properties:
- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device.
- rockchip,grf: MIPI TX1RX1 D-PHY not only has its own register but also
		the GRF, so it is only necessary for MIPI TX1RX1 D-PHY.

Device node example
-------------------

grf: syscon@ff770000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-grf", "syscon", "simple-mfd";

...

	dphy: mipi-dphy {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-mipi-dphy";
		clocks = <&cru SCLK_MIPIDPHY_REF>,
			<&cru SCLK_DPHY_RX0_CFG>,
			<&cru PCLK_VIO_GRF>;
		clock-names = "dphy-ref", "dphy-cfg", "grf";
		power-domains = <&power RK3399_PD_VIO>;
		#phy-cells = <0>;
	};
};
